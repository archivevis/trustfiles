# dotfiles
hey! this is reese's first dotfiles. made for bspwm, based on two things that released in april: (g)i-dle's mini-album i trust and the game persona 5 royal for the PS4 ~~but based more on the former than the latter~~. i started working on it over the course of a few days but really rushed during may 2nd.
